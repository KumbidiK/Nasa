    <h2>What is NASA Space Apps?</h2>
    <p>
      The NASA International Space Apps Challenge (Space Apps) is an international hackathon for coders,
      scientists, designers, storytellers, makers, builders, technologists, and others in cities around the world,
      where teams engage the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA’s) free and open data to
      address real-world problems on Earth and in space.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each October, over the course of two days, Space Apps brings participants from around the world together
      at hundreds of in-person and virtual local events to solve challenges submitted by NASA experts. After the
      hackathon, project submissions are judged by space agency experts and winners are selected for one of 10
      Global Awards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Space Apps provides problem-solvers worldwide with NASA’s free and open data, giving teams the
      opportunity to learn how to use these resources to solve each year’s challenges. Space Apps also inspire
      collaboration, creativity, and critical thinking. Our mission is to leverage this interest to encourage the growth
      and diversity of the next generation of scientists, technologists, designers, storytellers, and engineers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Space Apps 2025 is set to welcome 60,000+ participants from over 160 countries/territories, producing
      6,000+ projects in response to Earth &amp; Space Science challenge statements written by NASA.
